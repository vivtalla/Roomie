# Roomie

###Overview
	Roomie is a real-time communication application (iOS), specifically designed for communicating with your roommates or family members. Roomie is a useful and reliable way for users to experience both instant group messaging and task management into one easy-to-use app. The application follows a minimalistic design acting as a central hub for any household’s communication needs. 
	The integrated messaging terminal within Roomie is blazing fast. Designed via JSQ Swift libraries, Roomie will not fail to deliver messages to your iPhone very quickly. On top of that, task management is just as reliable allowing you to create and assign tasks to members of the Roomie group. 

###Sign Up for Roomie
	If you have never used the app or never created an account with Roomie, from the login menu tap on the button listed as “Sign Up”.
	In the first field that appears labeled “Email”, tap and enter a valid email address. Get creative with a secure password of at least 6 characters in length and input that into the field labeled “Password”. Verify that password’s validity by re-entering the password into the field labeled “Verify Password”. Once that is complete and valid, tap on “Create Account” to finalize the account creation. Once complete, click “Sign In” and proceed with the following steps.

###Log into Roomie
	Once you have created an account with Roomie, you will be prompted to return to the login screen. Unfortunately this redundant step is required in this build of Roomie.
	At this screen, in the first field enter in the email address you used to sign up and in the second field enter the secure password you created. Tap “Log in” once you have completed those steps. 

###Forgot Password
	From this screen, you also have the ability to reset your password in the case you forgot your password or require a password reset.

###Main Menu

###Tasks Screen
	From the tasks menu you have the ability to add and manage tasks. To add a task to the list, tap the + icon on the top right of the screen and follow the prompt to add a task. Once your task is added to the list, it will appear on the screen. To mark a task as complete, simply tap the task. You can tap the task again to mark it as incomplete.

###Group Chat
	In the Chat portion of the app, you have the ability to interact with your roommates! This should be very familiar as many instant messaging applications share this similar interface.

Tap send when complete. To change your screen name to be represented as a different name, double tap the word “Chat” at the top of the view. Tap Menu to return to the main menu.
